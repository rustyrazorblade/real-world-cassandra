## Foreword

This book will focus on the latest stable version of Apache Cassandra.  I'm targeting the most current release, which at the time of this writing is 4.0.  Once the next version is released, this book will be updated.

This is an opinionated book.  I will not advise using features that perform poorly in production or have so many caveats that failure is almost unavoidable.  This is not the result of marketing, promises, or speculation.

This book is the culmination of everything I've learned about running Apache Cassandra in production.  I have been lucky enough to have run it for several years at a startup, worked at DataStax as a technical evangelist, and while working at The Last Pickle I've helped fix and tune a wider variety of Cassandra clusters than almost anyone else on the planet.  

I'd like to thank a handful of people to have made this book possible.  I've made a lot of friends as the direct result of a technology choice.  A special thanks to Blake Eggleston, Patrick McFadin, Nate McCall, Aaron Morton, Caleb Rackliffe, Luke Tillman, and Jonathan Ellis.  Thank you to many others who I've had the privilege of working with and learning from over the years.
