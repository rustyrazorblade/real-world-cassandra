== Tables

Much like a relational database, we create structured tables with schema in Cassandra to store our data.

Tables contain <<Rows>>.

Unlike a traditional relational database, we need to specify how we want our data partitioned across
 
What can we use as a sort date


You might recognize this syntax:

```text
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id uuid PIRMARY KEY,
    data blob
);
```
