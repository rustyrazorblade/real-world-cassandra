== Primary Key



=== Partition Key


Partition key can be composed of one or more fields.  These fields are hashed to give us a token, which cooresponds to a position in the <<Token Ring>>, and that determines the replicas that a given partition lives on.

If we're using the above `CREATE TABLE` syntax you see above, a single field has been identified as the `PRIMARY KEY`.  That lone field is the partition key.

We can also use this syntax:

```text
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id uuid,
    data blob,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
```

=== Clustering Keys

One of the most powerful aspects of Cassandra's partitions is that they can contain one or more rows.  Rows in a partition are stored together, sequentially, in the order defined by the clustering keys.



```text
CREATE TABLE test.mytable (
    id int,
    clust int,
    data blob,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, clust)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (clust ASC)
```



```text
CREATE TABLE comlex (
    id uuid,
    bucket int,
    data blob,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, bucket)
);
```


Partitions
 sorted lists of rows

```text
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
  id uuid,
  ts timestamp,
  data blob
) PRIMARY KEY (id, ts);
```
