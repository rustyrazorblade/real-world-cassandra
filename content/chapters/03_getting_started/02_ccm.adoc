== Starting a Cluster with CCM

CCM is a useful tool for creating local clusters for testing.

You can get the source here https://github.com/riptano/ccm

```bash
pip install ccm
```



```bash
$ ccm create -n 3 -v 3.11.3 mc
Current cluster is now: mc
```

You can start your cluster:

```bash
$ ccm start
```

We'll be referencing this test cluster in the next chapter.
