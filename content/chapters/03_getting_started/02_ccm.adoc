== Starting a Cluster with CCM

CCM is a useful tool for creating local clusters for testing.

You can get the source here https://github.com/riptano/ccm

```bash
pip install ccm
```

ccm uses loopback aliases to run several Cassandra instances on one machine.  We'll get into the details of how this actually works when we start looking at configuration file options.  For now, just set them up with this in your shell:

```bash
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.3 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.4 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.5 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.6 up
```

Now you can create a cluster.  We'll create a single DC cluster with 3 nodes running 3.11.3:

```bash
$ ccm create -n 3 -v 3.11.3 mc
Current cluster is now: mc
```

Now you can start your cluster:

```bash
$ ccm start
```

We'll be referencing this test cluster in the next chapter.
