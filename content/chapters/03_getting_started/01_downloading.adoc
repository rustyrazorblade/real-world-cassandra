Once the download finishes

At the time of this writing, the latest version is 3.11.3.  Untar the archive:

```bash
$ tar -zxvf apache-cassandra-3.11.3-bin.tar.gz
```

Go into the directory and start Cassandra:

```bash
$ cd apache-cassandra-3.11.3
$ bin/cassandra -f
```

This will launch Cassandra in the foreground.

Open another terminal, go into the same directory and do the following:

```bash
$ bin/cqlsh
```

cqlsh will start up, and as long as the Cassandra server is running you'll see something like the following:

```bash
Connected to Test Cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.11.3 | CQL spec 3.4.4 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh>
```

You are now connected to Cassandra.

Switch back to the terminal running Cassandra and press control-c to stop.
