= Storage Engine

Cassandra's storage engine is implemented as a Log Structured Merge Tree, which has some interesting qualities.  We'll dig into that in this chapter.  At the end of this chapter you should have a good understanding of the different components of the storage engine.


Incoming writes are first written to a <<Commit Log>>.  This is pretty straightforward, if you've used other databases this should be familiar territory.

Once the commit log has been written to, data is then written to an in memory structure called a <<Memtable>>.

The <<Memtable>> is later flushed to disk, to a file called an SSTable.  There are some additional files that might be written out to accompany the SSTable, we'll cover that in the <<SSTable>> chapter.

Let's look at each component in a little more detail.
