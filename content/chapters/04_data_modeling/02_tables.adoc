== Tables

Much like a relational database, we create structured tables with schema in Cassandra to store our data.

Tables contain rows

Unlike a traditional relational database, we need to specify how we want our data partitioned across
 
What can we use as a sort date


You might recognize this syntax:

```text
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id uuid PIRMARY KEY,
    data blob
);
```

=== Partition Key



Partition key can be composed of one or more fields.  These fields are hashed to give us a token, which cooresponds to a position in the <<Token Ring>>, and that determines the replicas that a given partition lives on.


=== Clustering Keys

Clustering keys determine sorting order

```text
CREATE TABLE comlex (
    id uuid,
    bucket int,
    data blob,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, bucket)
);
```


Partitions
 sorted lists of rows

```text
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
  id uuid,
  ts timestamp,
  data blob
) PRIMARY KEY (id, ts);
```
