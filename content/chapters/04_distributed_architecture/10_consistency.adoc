== Consistency Levels

Writes can go to any node

In the case of a write, consistency defines the number of nodes that must acknowledge (ACK) the write.


In the case of a read, consistency defines the number of nodes that are queried, and in the case of an inconsistency, a read repair is performed.


=== ONE and LOCAL_ONE

Only one node is required to acknowledge the write for the <<coordinator>> to return a success message to the client.

=== ALL

All nodes are required to acknowledge the write for the <<coordinator>> to return a success message to the client.


=== QUORUM and LOCAL_QUORUM



TIP: Use the lowest consistency level possible to achieve the best uptime.
